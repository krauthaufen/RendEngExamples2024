## Design & Implementation of a Rendering Engine, Lecture @ [TU WIEN](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/RendEng/VU/2024W)

### Lecturers

Daniel Cornel, Georg Haaser, Christian Luksch, Andreas Walch, Stefan Maierhofer, Harald Steinlechner, Attila Szabo


### Learning outcomes
After successful completion of the course, students are able to plan, implement, test and evaluate the design and programming of a rendering engine. The scene description, graphical APIs and optimization techniques play an important role.

### Subject of course
In this course we will focus on the following topics:

Requirements for the design of rendering engines
Hardware and Graphics APIs (OpenGL, Direct3D, Vulkan,..)
Scene Representation (Scene graphs, display lists, command buffers,...)
Static and Dynamic Data (Incremental Update Techniques)
Optimizations (Caching, Culling, Level of Detail, Bounding Volume Hierarchies, Just-In-Time Optimization)
Resource Management 
Domain Specific Languages (HLSL, Spark, FShade, Semantic Scene Graph,..)
Reusable Components/Design for Rendering Engines
